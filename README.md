# HangmanGame-in-cpp
I made this Hangman game (C++) during my 2nd semester in by bachelors.
Code is very simple. I have added comments too.
There are 3 different modes for guessing words easy, medium and hard.
# Size of words in each mode:
Easy --- 3 characters
Medium - 5 characters
Hard --- 7 characters
# Working
Tries are same 7 in each mode, on every single wrong character guess a life is wasted and person is shown hanging.
or on every single right character guess the words becomes more guessable as every guessed character is shown on it's exact place in the word.
